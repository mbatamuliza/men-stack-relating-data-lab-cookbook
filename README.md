## About

In this lab, you'll create **Cookbook**, a full-stack application for managing recipes and pantry items for cooking enthusiasts. As part of these exercises you'll practice relating data to a user model using either embedding or referencing techniques with Mongoose and perform full CRUD operations on multiple models. Additionally, users can explore other enthusiasts' profiles, sharing and drawing inspiration from their culinary experiences.

### Starter code

This lecture uses the [`MEN Stack Auth Template`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-session-auth-template) as starter code. Doing so allows us to have a connection established to our MongoDB Atlas, add functioning auth for our user model, and install some of the packages we will need for our app build.
