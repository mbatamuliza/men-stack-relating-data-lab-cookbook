## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/labs` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/labs
```

## Cloning the Auth boilerplate

This lab uses the [`MEN Stack Auth Template`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-session-auth-template) as starter code. Doing so allows us to have a connection established to our MongoDB Atlas, add functioning auth for our user model, and install some of the packages we will need for our app build.

Navigate to the [MEN Stack Auth Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-session-auth-template) and clone the repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-session-auth-template.git
```

Once cloned, rename this application to today's lab `men-stack-relating-data-lab-cookbook`:

```bash
mv men-stack-session-auth-template men-stack-relating-data-lab-cookbook
```

Next, `cd` into your renamed directory:

```bash
cd men-stack-relating-data-lab-cookbook
```

Finally, remove the existing `.git` information from this template:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

> Removing the `.git` info is important as this is just a starter template provided by GA. You do not need the existing git history for this project.

## GitHub setup

To add this project to GitHub, initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
```

Make a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) named `men-stack-relating-data-lab-cookbook`.

Link your local project to your remote GitHub repo:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<github-username>/men-stack-relating-data-lab-cookbook.git
git push origin main
```

> ðŸš¨ Do not copy the above command. It will not work. Your GitHub username will replace `<github-username>` (including the `<` and `>`) in the URL above.

Open the project's folder in your code editor:

```bash
code .
```

## Create your .env

Add a `.env` file to your application and add the following secret keys to your application.

```text
MONGODB_URI=
SESSION_SECRET=
```

## Create your .gitignore

Add a `.gitignore` file with the following;

```text
node_modules
.env
```

## Install packages

Install packages using the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

**Run your application and test the authentication before you begin your lab.**

Happy Coding!
